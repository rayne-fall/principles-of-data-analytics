# principles-of-data-analytics

This repository contains my project work for the Spring 2024 PRINCIPLES OF DATA ANALYTICS module at Atlantic Technological University. The project work itself is contained in the Jupyter notebook and the references are listed below.

## Table of Contents
- Introduction
- Imports
- Loading the dataset
- Examining the data
    - Examining the first penguin
    - Counting the species
    - Counting the population of each island
    - Counting the sexes
    - Describing the set
- Modelling the dataset
    - Types of variables
    - Plotting the species counts
    - Plotting the bill length
- Relationship between body mass and flipper length
- Conclusion

## Required software

The project is contained in a Jupyter notebook, so you'll need to install Python. I've used [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for this. You'll also need a notebook editor. I've used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but you can use whichever one you prefer.
